PHP Wrapper for the [Screeenly API](http://screeenly.com). You must have a Screeenly account to use this package.

**Important notice:** This package has been abandoned! I want to focus on more useful projects and the screeenly API is already [very easy to use](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/screeenly/wiki/Use-the-API).

## Installation

Install the package with composer:

Guzzle v6:     
```
$ composer require "wnx/screeenly-client:~2.0"
```

Guzzle v5:   
```
$ composer require "wnx/screeenly-client:~1.0"
```

For Laravel 4 prjoects:   
```
$ composer require "wnx/screeenly-client:~0.3"
```

## Usage

### Laravel 5 

> [Read more](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/ScreeenlyClient/tree/v0.3.0) for Laravel 4 usage.

Add the following code to your `providers` array in `app/conifg/app.php`:

```php
...

'Wnx\ScreeenlyClient\ScreeenlyClientServiceProvider',
```

Publish the configration file and add your Screeenly API Key in `config/screeenly_client.php`.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Wnx\ScreeenlyClient\ScreeenlyClientServiceProvider"

Now you have access to the Screenshot Facade. Use it like the example below:

```php
$path       = public_path('/');
$screenshot = Screenshot::capture('http://google.com');
$localPath  = $screenshot->store($path, 'screenshot.jpg');
```


### Non-Laravel Usage

```php
use Wnx\ScreeenlyClient\Screenshot;
...

$screenshot = new Screenshot($key);
$screenshot->capture('http://google.com');
$localPath = $screenshot->store('path/to/image/store/', 'screenshot.jpg');
```
